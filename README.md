## Introduction 
Don't you think that robots are taking over the world? Well, you probably think there's no way they can take my girlfriend away frome me! That's where you're wrong!!! In this program, using machine learning and image processing, there will be an AI that does see you and your significant other faster than you and have a heart surrounding their face!

Thanks to some really great librariers from Opencv that got me going, I was able to start doing some programming on machine learning and image processing. This project started at HackED 2019 and most of my time was spent on learning machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, histograms of orientated gradients, and 

However, the facial recognition was not cooperating with me so I will be implementing some deep learning and possibly eigen value face recognition or local binary patterns histogram algorithms to go from face detection to face recognition.
